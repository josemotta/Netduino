Hi DevBiker,

To manually flash firmware using ST DFUSE tools, grab the latest copy of ST's DFUSE tools from the download link at the bottom of the following page:
http://www.st.com/we...SS1533/PF257916

To erase your board's firmware (do this first): ---> não precisou, a gravação abaixo apaga antes
1. Detach your Netduino
2. Press and hold your Netduino's pushbutton while plugging it in via USB; this will put it in bootloader mode.
3. Erase the firmware on your Netduino using the STDFU Tester application
> a. Select the "Protocol" tab
> b. Press the "Create from Map" button
> c. Select the "Erase" radio button option
> d. Press the "Go" button
> e. Wait for erase process to complete

To create the DFU files which you will program onto your Netduino:
1. Run "DFU File Manager" (from the ST DFU tools)
2. Select "I want to GENERATE a DFU file" and press OK.
3. Click "S19 or HEX..." and then select one of the firmware files in Netduino Update's respective Firmware folder.
4. Click the "generate" button to generate a DFU file which contains the S19 (HEX) file you picked in step 3.
5. Click "delete selected image".
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the other two firmware files.

Finally, flash each of the .DFU files using the ST DfuSe Demonstrator application (included with STDFU Tester).
1. Run "ST DfuSe Demonstrator"
2. Locate the "Upgrade or Verify Action" pane (bottom-right pane)
3. Press "Choose..." and select one of the generated DFU files
4. Check the "Verify after download" option
5. Press "Upgrade". It will take a few moments to update your Netduino.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the other two firmware files.

After you have flashed all the .DFU files, detach and reattach your Netduino (power cycle) or press "Leave DFU mode".

This takes quite a few more steps than Netduino Update, but it should get you back up and running.

Did these instructions enable you to reflash your board?
