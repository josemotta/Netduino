/**
 * 09/Apr/2012: 
 *  Added an optional parameter to the constructor, so that the
 *  IncomingData reader can be initialized. This allows to
 *  create transport driver outside the Cet.NETMF.IO
 *  assembly (the IncomingData property set is internal).
 *  Thanks to: http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/gralinpl
